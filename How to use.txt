Use something like:
NoDelayTimer timer(1000);
or
NoDelayTimer timer(1000,0,10);//Sets a start and end phase which must be positive


*unsigned long getElapsedTime();
void setDesiredDelay(unsigned long l); //Used if you wish to change the delay after creation (then it resets)

*boolean isTimeUp();

ALWAYS manually reset or it won't work

void resetTimer(); //resets the timer

Optionally used program phases:
int getPhase();
void setPhase(int newPhase);//No bounds check
void incrementPhase();//Increments and resets the phase between start and end only if you have set them
